# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python IBM 
During this course by IBM, I learned key database concepts, how to execute SQL queries, and perform database operations using Db2. The course emphasized efficiently retrieving, manipulating, and analyzing data with SQL and Python, offering hands on experience with real world tasks.

In the final assignment, I was initially required to use Db2, but encountered issues with my personal Db2 account. To overcome this challenge, I had to explore an alternative solution and after researching different approaches, I decided to use SQLite as a temporary replacement so I :
1- Created a local SQLite database to serve as a temporary solution to Db2.
2- Imported the required data into the SQLite database for processing.
3- Used Python libraries such as sqlite3 and pandas to execute the necessary SQL queries on the database.

Despite the unexpected challenge, this experience helped me develop problem solving skills and adaptability by finding a practical workaround to complete the task on time.
